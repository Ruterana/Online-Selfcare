                   <h3>I.What is Reproductive system?</h3> 
                    <p>The female reproductive system is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in reproduction of new offspring.<br>
                    In the human the female reproductive system is immature at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes,<br>
                    and to carry a foetus to full term. The internal sex organs are the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries.<br>
                    The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the foetus.</p>

            <h3>II.What is Menstrual cycle?</h3>
            <p>The menstrual cycle is the monthly series of changes a woman's body goes through in preparation for the possibility of pregnancy.<br> 
                Each month, one of the ovaries releases an egg. 
                At the same time, hormonal changes prepare the uterus for pregnancy.<br> 
                If ovulation takes place and the egg isn't fertilized,the lining of the uterus sheds through the vagina.</p>

            <h3>III.What is Ovulation?</h3>
            <p>Ovulation is the release of an egg from one of a woman's ovaries.<br>
                After the egg is released, it travels down the fallopian tube,where fertilization by a sperm cell may occur.<br>
                Ovulation typically lasts one day and occurs in the middle of a woman's menstrual cycle, about two weeks before she expects to get her period.<br>
                But the timing of the process varies for each woman, and it may even vary from month to month.</p>
