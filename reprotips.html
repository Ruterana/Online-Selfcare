                   <h3>I.What is Reproductive system?</h3> 
                    <p>The female reproductive system is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in reproduction of new offspring.<br>
                    In the human the female reproductive system is immature at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes,<br>
                    and to carry a foetus to full term. The internal sex organs are the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries.<br>
                    The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the foetus.</p>

                    <h3>II.What is Menstrual cycle?</h3>
                    <p>The menstrual cycle is the monthly series of changes a woman's body goes through in preparation for the possibility of pregnancy.<br> 
                        Each month, one of the ovaries releases an egg. 
                        At the same time, hormonal changes prepare the uterus for pregnancy.<br> 
                        If ovulation takes place and the egg isn't fertilized,the lining of the uterus sheds through the vagina.</p>

                    <h3>III.What is Ovulation?</h3>
                    <p>Ovulation is the release of an egg from one of a woman's ovaries.<br>
                        After the egg is released, it travels down the fallopian tube,where fertilization by a sperm cell may occur.<br>
                        Ovulation typically lasts one day and occurs in the middle of a woman's menstrual cycle, about two weeks before she expects to get her period.<br>
                        But the timing of the process varies for each woman, and it may even vary from month to month.</p>

                    <h3>VI.What is Periods?</h3>
                    <p>Menstruation marks the beginning of a woman's reproductive years.<br> 
                        From the time when she has her first period, or a few days before, she can become pregnant.<br>
                        A young woman will notice her first period because blood will come from her vagina.<br>
                        A woman has two ovaries, each of which contains a number of eggs.<br>
                        Every month during the reproductive years an egg will be released.<br>
                        Also, every month, the womb prepares a lining in case the egg should become fertilized.<br>
                        If the egg does not become fertilized, the lining is not needed and, together with the egg, it will be shed.We see this shedding as blood.
